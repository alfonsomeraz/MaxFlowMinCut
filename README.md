# MaxFlowMinCut
This repository stores the maximum flow minimum cut algorithmic analysis code for EC504: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms


### Theorem
In computer science and optimization theory, the max-flow min-cut theorem states that in a flow network, the maximum amount of flow passing from the source to the sink is equal to the total weight of the edges in a minimum cut, i.e., the smallest total weight of the edges which if removed would disconnect the source from the sink.
